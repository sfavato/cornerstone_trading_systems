## Getting Started

Welcome to HarmoFinder. Here is the simple process for getting your account set up and ready to receive trading signals.

1.  **Log In:** Access the platform using your credentials. We use a secure sign-in method to protect your account.
2.  **Connect Your Exchange:** Navigate to the "Account" or "Settings" page. You will need to generate API keys from your preferred crypto exchange (e.g., Bitget, Binance). Follow the on-screen instructions to add your API keys. *(Note: For security, ensure API permissions are set to "Trade" and "Read" only. Never enable "Withdrawal" permissions.)*
3.  **Configure Your Risk:** In your dashboard, set your desired risk parameters. This typically includes "Risk per Trade" (e.g., 1% of your account) and "Max Leverage." The bot will use these settings to calculate position sizes automatically.
4.  **Enable Trading:** Once configured, you can toggle the bot "On" from your main dashboard. The bot will now begin monitoring for new, high-confidence Trade Signals to execute on your behalf.
