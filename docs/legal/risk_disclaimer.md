# Risk Disclaimer: A Tool for Professional Decision-Making

This document is not just a legal formality; it is an educational tool designed to help you understand the risks and realities of algorithmic trading.

!!! danger "Trading is a Zero-Sum Game"
    HarmoFinder is not a money-printing machine. It is a statistical decision-support tool designed to identify high-probability setups in a competitive, zero-sum environment. For every winner, there is a loser. Your edge comes from discipline, risk management, and the proper application of this tool.

!!! warning "Understand Our 'Max Drawdown'"
    Our public "Glass Box" dashboard displays a historical **Max Drawdown** of X% (the value will be dynamically loaded). This means that, at some point in its history, the strategy experienced a peak-to-trough decline of this magnitude. You should be financially and psychologically prepared for a similar or even larger drawdown in the future.

!!! note "Past Performance Does Not Guarantee Future Results"
    The "Glass Box" is a historical record, not a promise. Market conditions change, and the strategies that worked in the past may not work in the future. The dashboard is a tool for transparency, not a crystal ball.

!!! info "This is Not Financial Advice"
    HarmoFinder is a software product, not a financial advisor. All trades executed based on its signals are your own. You are solely responsible for managing your risk and making your own investment decisions.
