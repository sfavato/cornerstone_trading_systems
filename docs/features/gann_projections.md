# Gann Projections

Gann Projections are an advanced technical analysis tool for "Pro" and "Quant" traders. They use the geometric and mathematical principles of W.D. Gann to identify potential support and resistance levels as well as market turning points.

## What the Tool Provides

Our implementation includes "Gann Boxes" and "Gann Fans" that are automatically drawn from the significant pivot points (A and D points) of our detected harmonic patterns.

- **Key Levels:** The interface displays key price levels derived from Gann angles (1x1, 1x2, 2x1, etc.).
- **Time Zones:** The tool also projects time zones where the probability of a trend reversal is higher.

## Strategic Use Cases

- **Profit Zone Confirmation:** Use Gann levels as more confluent "Take Profit" targets for your trading signals.
- **Trade Invalidation:** If the price breaks a major Gann level without a reaction, it can serve as an early invalidation signal for your initial trade idea.
