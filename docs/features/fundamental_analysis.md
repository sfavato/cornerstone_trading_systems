# Integrated Fundamental Analysis

For crypto-assets, technical analysis alone is insufficient. We have integrated fundamental and on-chain metrics directly into the interface to provide a 360-degree view.

## Key Metrics Available

Each asset page includes a "Fundamental Analysis" tab with the following data:

- **On-Chain Data:**
    - **MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value):** To identify if the asset is overvalued or undervalued.
    - **Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL):** Measures the overall market sentiment (Euphoria, Anxiety, Capitulation).
    - **Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model:** For Bitcoin, compares scarcity to production.

- **Financial Data (for tokenized stocks):**
    - **P/E (Price-to-Earnings) and P/S (Price-to-Sales) Ratios:** For basic valuation.
    - **Quarterly Revenue Data:** Visualized to identify growth.

## Strategic Use Cases

- **Macro Filter:** Use this data to avoid trading against a fundamental trend. A technical buy signal on an asset with an MVRV indicating extreme overvaluation is a low-probability trade.
- **Position Size Allocation:** Increase your position size when technical and fundamental analysis are aligned.
