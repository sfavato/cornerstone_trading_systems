# Performance Dashboard ("Glass Box")

Trust through transparency is our guiding principle. The performance dashboard is not just a marketing showcase; it's a real-time analysis tool designed for serious traders. It offers an unfiltered, aggregated view of the historical performance of **all** pattern detection strategies.

## Key Metrics Displayed

The dashboard is designed to go beyond simple "win rates."

- **Equity Curve:** A visualization of the growth (or decline) of a $10,000 starting capital, trading all signals.
- **Profit Factor:** The ratio of gross profits to gross losses. A value greater than 1.0 indicates a profitable strategy.
- **Maximum Drawdown:** The largest peak-to-trough percentage loss. This is an essential measure of risk.
- **Score Distribution Chart:** A histogram showing the distribution of "Confidence Scores" (0-100) on historical trades. This helps you visualize which score threshold has been the most profitable.
- **Filtering by Asset / Timeframe:** Allows users to analyze performance on specific markets (e.g., BTC/USD vs. ETH/USD).

## How to Use It

- **Risk Analysis:** Before following a strategy, evaluate its maximum drawdown to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance.
- **Filter Optimization:** Use the distribution chart to decide which "Confidence Score" threshold (e.g., 70, 75, 80?) you want to require for your own trades.
- **Identify Market Regimes:** By filtering by date, you can analyze how the strategy has performed during different market conditions (e.g., bull market vs. bear market).
