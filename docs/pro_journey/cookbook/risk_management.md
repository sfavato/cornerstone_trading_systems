# Risk Management for Algorithmic Patterns

Effective risk management is non-negotiable for sustainable trading. This guide outlines two critical components: **Position Sizing** and **Stop-Loss Placement**.

## Position Sizing

Position sizing is the process of determining how many units of an asset to trade. A common mistake is to risk a fixed percentage of the account on every trade, regardless of the asset's volatility. A more robust approach is to base the position size on volatility.

    Never risk more than you can afford to lose. This guide is for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

## Stop-Loss Placement

A stop-loss is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell a security when it reaches a certain price. Stop-losses are designed to limit an investor's loss on a security position.

For harmonic patterns, the stop-loss is typically placed just beyond the `X` point of the pattern. This is because the `X` point represents the structural failure of the pattern.

    There is no guarantee that a stop-loss order will be executed at or near the stop-loss price. During periods of high volatility, the price may gap through the stop-loss level.

## Reading the "Glass Box"

Our "Glass Box" dashboard provides key performance metrics, such as **Max Drawdown** and **Profit Factor**. You should use these historical metrics to set your personal risk expectations. For example, if the historical Max Drawdown is 20%, you should be prepared for a similar drawdown in your own trading.
