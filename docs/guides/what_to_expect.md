## What to Expect (The Signals)

The HarmoFinder bot is a **high-timeframe (HTF)** system. This means it primarily operates on the 4-hour, 1-day, and 3-day charts. It is not a high-frequency (HFT) or scalping bot.

*   **Patience is Key:** You may not see a new trade every day. The bot is designed to be highly selective and will wait patiently—sometimes for days—for an "A+" setup that meets its strict Confidence Score threshold.
*   **Signal Notifications:** When a validated Trade Signal is detected, you will receive a notification (e.g., via Discord or Telegram). This notification will include the Asset, Direction (LONG/SHORT), Entry Price, Stop Loss, and Take Profit targets.
*   **Trade Management:** If you have auto-trading enabled, the bot will manage the trade for you, moving the stop loss to break-even at the appropriate time and taking profit at predefined targets.
